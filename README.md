### Software Engineer and musician.  
I find joy in building elegant and tailored solutions for complex multi domain problems,
to serve real people (or at the very least, me).

### I am currently building:  
- iOS Game Releasing on the App Store soon!
  - Godot + C#  
  - Server-authority for player progress / unlocks using REST + JSON payloads  
  - P2P multi-authority multiplayer using websocket + Protobuf packets  
  - Game client is closed source but my [production nakama server](https://github.com/cra88y/block-server) is open source
  - Stay tuned for the public TestFlight in the next couple months :)

### Current hobby dev interest:  
**Web Search**. Currently through SearXNG extensions to help us better explore the ever expanding yet consolidating web.
 - [4get-hijacked](https://github.com/cra88y/4get-hijacked)
   - Flexible, decoupled, and fast sidecar/wrapper container to run any 4get native search engines (30+!) in parallel, to fetch results for your Searxng instance.
   - Built to bridge the efforts of 4get's dedicated alternative scraper efforts to SearXNG while providing a translation layer to support as many features on both sides as is possible.
 - ai-answers-searxng
   - Non-blocking/async SearXNG plugin that generates an AI response to user query while utilizing the results for grounding. 
   - Supports variety of models with both OpenRouter and Gemini API support.
 - [simply-nord](https://github.com/cra88y/simply-nord)
   - An extensive minimalist nord inspired theme + ui tweaks for SearXNG, focused on usability and readability.
