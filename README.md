Software Engineer and musician.
I love to build out elegant and tailored solutions to complex problems to serve real people (or at least, me).



**Current hobby dev interest**: Web Search. Currently through SearXNG extensions to help us better explore the ever expanding yet consolidating web.
 - [4get-hijacked](https://github.com/cra88y/4get-hijacked) Flexible, decoupled, and fast sidecar/wrapper container to run any 4get native search engines (30+!) in parallel, to fetch results for your Searxng instance. Built to bridge the efforts of 4get's dedicated alternative scraper efforts to SearXNG while providing a translation layer to support as many features on both sides as is possible.
 - ai-answers-searxng Non-blocking/async SearXNG plugin that generates an AI response to user query while utilizing the results for grounding. Supports variety of models with both OpenRouter and Gemini API support.
 - [simply-nord](https://github.com/cra88y/simply-nord) An extensive minimalist nord inspired theme + ui tweaks for SearXNG.
